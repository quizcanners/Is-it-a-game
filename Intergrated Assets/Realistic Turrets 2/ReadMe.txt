Thank you for buying Realistic Turrets 2!

Just drag and drop the turrets from Prefabs folder to your scene.

To rotate turret parts select parent nodes of meshes (body or gun), not actual mesh (i.e. body_LOD0).

You can change color of paint. Albedo textures are in PSD format with separate layers. 

If you don't see anything in the example scene: select any object in the Hierarchy window and press F.
Materials may appear too dark if there is no baked reflection probes in your scene.

Textures are calibrated for "linear" color space.

Contact me if you need help.

Have you seen my other assets?
