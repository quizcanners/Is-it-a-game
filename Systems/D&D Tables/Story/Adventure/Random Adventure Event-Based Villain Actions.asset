    Description:
      Value: " The villain\u2019s plans come to fruition during a festival, an astrological
        event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a royal wedding, the birth of a child, or
        some similar fixed time. The villain\u2019s activities up to that point are
        geared toward preparation for this event."
    Name: Big event
    _includeName: 1
  - Chances: 1
    subTables: []
    Description:
      Value: The villain commits acts that become bolder and more heinous over time.
        A killer might start out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before
        moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing the horror and the
        body count each time.
    Name: Crime spree
    _includeName: 1
  - Chances: 1
    subTables: []
    Description:
      Value: "As time passes, the villain\u2019s power and influence grow, affecting
        more victims across a larger area. This might take the form of armies conquering
        new territory, an evil cult recruiting new members, or a spreading plague.
        A pretender to the throne might attempt to secure the support of the kingdom\u2019s
        nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a coup, or a guild leader could
        corrupt the members of a town council or bribe officers of the watch."
    Name: Growing corruption
    _includeName: 1
  - Chances: 1
    subTables: []
    Description:
      Value: " The villain commits a single crime and then tries to avoid the consequences.
        Instead of an ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain\u2019s goal
        is to lie low or flee the scene."
    Name: One and done
    _includeName: 1
  - Chances: 1
    subTables: []
    Description:
      Value: The villain commits crimes one after the other, but these acts are repetitive
        in nature, rather than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The trick
        to catching such a villain lies in determining the pattern underlying the
        crimes. Though serial killers are a common example of this type of villain,
        your villain could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of building,
        a magical sickness that affects spellcasters who cast a specific spell, a
        thief that targets a certain kind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping
        and impersonating one noble after another.
    Name: Serial crimes
    _includeName: 1
  - Chances: 1
    subTables: []
    Description:
      Value: In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries out a specific set of actions
        in a particular sequence. A wizard might steal the items needed to create
        a phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap the priests of
        seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. Alternatively, the villain could
        be following a trail to find the object of its revenge, killing one victim
        after another while moving ever closer to the real target.
